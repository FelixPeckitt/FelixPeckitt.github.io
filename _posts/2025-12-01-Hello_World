# What are weeknotes and why start now?

<p>Some of the thinkers and doers I admire write - I only find out what they think because they write. I’d like to have a crack at this too.<p>

[about weeknotes](https://promo.cymru/resource-articles/weeknotes/)

<p>The intention is to supplement this with some more organised articles, perhaps one a month. Substack seems to be the place to go for that.<p>

<p>At a point in time when generating text generically is easy, developing my voice seems like a task - but here I am nonetheless.<p>

<p>Expect links to things I read, filtered takes of what I’ve done and thought this week, and always an invitation to collaborate and discuss.<p>

## My work right now:

- implementing the London data service, linked data and tools to use it covering c. 15 million patients in London. North Centra London has around 1.8m people, and I’m getting tools, governance, high quality data in place for the ICB
- Preparing for a merger between North Central and North West London. That’s mapping data infrastructure, and making a plan for the target architecture, with a milestone at 01/04/2026
- MSc Imperial - Digital Health Leadership. Innovation study on AI enabled heart failure management in Camden GP federation. Literature review.

## Highlights:

- Managers in Partnership away Day - meeting with other union reps from across the country. Organising and campaigning for excellent management and managers in the NHS. Connecting and making sense of the 18,000 redundancies
- Reviewing automated data quality testing with DBT by Jonathan Linney. This was an independent project delivered on time, fulfilling an issue we had faced in inaccurate date, by a data engineer on level 5 apprenticeship. Feels like the focus on applied technical skills and support in taking ownership for delivering manageable pieces of technical work is paying off.
- Met with Hex from Health data avatar - interesting start up. Patients upload their medical records, personal thoughts, recorded observations about their health. The system can produce AI summaries and share records with healthcare professionals. Could this support people with complex conditions build trust with a health system which has historically failed them? Could this help share things with healthcare providers on a need to know, not want to know basis?
- Applying to BRAID stakeholder forum - BRAID looks at how AI can be used responsibly in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Funded by AHRI. [https://braiduk.org](https://braiduk.org/)

## Reading:

- AIPN - how can we be so sure risk stratification is a good idea? The strategy unit gives advice in their 2024 paper on a spot check before diving in too deep
- Prostate Cemcer Screening expert panel. The discourse here was revealing in how data-driven decision making on health policy works in the wild. A complex topic, with political implications. High profile figures affected by prostate cancer are against. Experts are grappling with imperfect tests, and health economic outcomes which suggest that nothing can be done with slow growing cancers. Making the right decision and selling the decision again seem to be different things
- Six sigma and systems reliability in Python - something to have in my back pocket, very accessible [Lean 6 sigma and systems realiability in Python](https://timothyfraser.com/sigma/multivariate-regression-modeling-effects-of-disaster-on-social-capital.html)
